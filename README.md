# bookmarklets

Bookmarklets I created to make my life easier.

## autoscroll.js

[This bookmarklet](scripts/autoscroll.js) simply smoothly scroll a webpage until the end. Useful for recording a scrolling page without doing anything manually, at the same speed.

## meetup-notifications.js

[This bookmarklet](scripts/meetup-notifications.js) unsubscribe to the notifications I don't want to receive from most meetups since I'm a member of multiple ones around the world, and it doesn't make sense to receive all the notifications when I'm not there.
